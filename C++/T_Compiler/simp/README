This directory contains the source code for a compiler for a very
simple language called Simp.

The compiler reads a Simp program from stdin. And it writes a dump
of the AST for the program (after semantic analysis) to stderr. The
AST is dumped in prefix form, one AST node per line.

To build the compiler: make

To run the compiler: simpc <input.simp >output.s

To assembly and link the output of the compiler: gcc output.s RTS.c

To build a stand-alone version of the scanner: make lexdbg

To run the stand-alone scanner: lexdbg <input.simp

The stand-alone scanner will read the input program from stdin and
will write the tokens to stdout, one per line.

simp.simp is a very simple Simp program that can be processed by
the Simp compiler and has the extra benefit of revealing
the meaning of the universe.

test.simp is another Simp program that can be processed by the Simp compiler.

bad.simp is a Simp program with semantic errors.
