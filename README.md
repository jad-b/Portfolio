Portfolio
=========

A selection of my works, by programming language. Currently, this is only composed of my college work. 
Each section has an additional readme.md file to act as a short table of contents for your navigation.

I have an additional body of work, done in the key of C, from an Algorithms class that shows off
implementations of some more complex ideas. I can produce this on request.
